1.  INTRODUCTION
-----------------

This application has been developed to allow users to capture and display data from Cisco devices using the netflow V5 over UDP transport.
Initially is was an exercise for displaying network traffic to students in a network management class at the college of west anglia (hence the CWA path)
Now released as open source it will be updated over time to support sflow (v5) as outlined in the documentation at www.sflow.org - help an support would 
always be appreciated!!    

-------------------
2.  LATEST VERSION
-------------------

V0.1 available at https://github.com/dave-turvey/netflow.git

-----------------
3.  DOCUMENTATION
-----------------
The application has two components:

Netflow server 				- Listens on a port for netflow data from devices (A netflow collector)
Netflow Chart Application 	- Displays the CSV data generated by the netflow server

CONFIGURING THE NETFLOW SERVER: 

You will need to configure your netflow devices to export the netflow data. Details of this can be found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/netflow/configuration/guide/cfg_nflow_data_expt_ps6922_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html

 
The Netflow server is currently hard coded to listen on UDP port 9876
The netflow server currently supports netflow V5 format only
The data is output to the current working directory as flowdata.csv

USING THE NETFLOW CHARTING APPLICATION

You need to run the chart application in the same folder as the flowdata.csv. The application currently displays 
totals by ip in a time series chart.

-----------------
4.  DEPENDENCIES
-----------------

The netflow chart application requires JFreechart which is available at http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/

6.  ANT BUILD SCRIPT

The ant build script used to build the distribution and is included in the top level as build.xml. To run the 
ant script directly from the command line, edit the buildit.bat file to set the environment variables to ant and
jfreechart installations, then just run buildit. The final jar is placed in the dist folder.

8.  LIMITATIONS
---------------
As V0.1 there are a large number of limitations, not least:

No support for versions other than netflow V5 format
No support for multiple charts 
No file rotation or file management for long term capture of data
Hard coded paths, system printouts, filenames and UDP port
