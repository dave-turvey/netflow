With Java, you probably want:
 A build script (perhaps written in Ant) to build (javac), test (java and junit), document (javadoc) and package (jar) your application/lib
 Some unittests to make sure the thing works ok (this can evolve later on, but the framework is good to have)
 Some comments that are suitable for JavaDoc (if developers are your intended audience), 

And, for any project:
 a README file saying what the project is about - COMPLETE
 a LICENSE file explaining how to copy - COMPLETE
 Some list of changes, versions, etc (evolvable) - COMPLETE
 Quick-start compile/install guide (what dependencies and os:es do you require) - COMPLETE
 Some actual documentation, faq and usage examples (for the end-user) - COMPLETE
 Also, AUTHORS/HACKING files are common, listing everyone that's been involved (important for copyright) and HACKING describes how to contribute.
 
Names of files may vary, and some put all this in HTML somewhere, but this is the typical setup.
